# MUXI Licensing

MUXI uses a dual-license model to balance open-source accessibility with sustainable development.

## License Summary

| Component | License | Type |
|-----------|---------|------|
| Server | [Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2)](https://github.com/muxi-ai/server/?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme) | Source-available |
| Runtime | [Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2)](https://github.com/muxi-ai/runtime/?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme) | Source-available |
| CLI | [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/muxi-ai/cli/?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file#readme) | Fully permissive |
| SDKs | [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/muxi-ai/sdks/?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file#readme) | Fully permissive |
| Schemas | [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/muxi-ai/schemas/?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file#readme) | Fully permissive |
| OneLLM | [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/muxi-ai/onellm/?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file#readme) | Fully permissive |
| FAISSx | [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/muxi-ai/faissx/?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file#readme) | Fully permissive |


## What You CAN Do

- ✅ Use freely for internal projects, products, and research
- ✅ Use freely for building platforms and commercial applications
- ✅ Build and sell products that use MUXI
- ✅ Deploy for clients and customers
- ✅ Self-host on your infrastructure

## What You CAN'T Do

- ❌ Offer MUXI itself as a hosted service

## Bottom Line

If you're building AI agents for your product or business, you're good to go. The restriction only applies if you're trying to resell MUXI-as-a-Service.

## Why This Model?

The ELv2 license on the Server and Runtime prevents cloud providers from offering MUXI as a competing managed service without contributing back. Everything else (Formations, CLI, SDKs) is fully permissive Apache 2.0, so you can freely integrate, modify, and distribute those components.
