# Glossary

Quick reference for MUXI terminology.

---

## A

### A2A (Agent-to-Agent)
Protocol enabling agents across different formations to communicate and collaborate. Allows cross-formation task delegation.

### Agent
A specialized worker within a formation. Has a system prompt (instructions) and capabilities (tools). The Overlord routes tasks to the most appropriate agent.

### Agent Formation Schema (AFS)
YAML configuration format for defining formations. Files use `.afs` extension. Describes agents, tools, memory, triggers, and all formation behavior.

### Artifact
Binary or structured output generated by agents (PDFs, images, CSV files, charts). Returned as Base64-encoded data with MIME type.

### Async Mode
Processing mode for long-running tasks. User gets immediate acknowledgment; results delivered via webhook when complete. Overlord automatically decides sync vs async based on estimated task duration.

---

## B

### Buffer Memory
Short-term conversation storage within a session. Holds recent messages for context. Cleared when session ends.

---

## C

### Clarification
When the Overlord needs more information to complete a task, it asks the user follow-up questions. Supports multi-turn clarification flows with context preservation.

### Credential (User)
Per-user API keys/tokens for external services (GitHub, Slack, etc.). Stored encrypted, isolated per user. Enables personalized tool access.

---

## F

### FAISSx
MUXI's FAISS wrapper for vector similarity search. Can run embedded or as a standalone server for shared memory across multiple formation instances.

### Formation
A deployable unit containing agents, tools, memory configuration, and behavior definitions. The atomic unit of deployment in MUXI. Defined in `.afs` files.

---

## H

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
Approval workflow requiring human confirmation before executing sensitive actions. Configurable per action type with timeout and escalation rules.

---

## K

### Knowledge
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. Embeds documents and retrieves relevant context for agent responses. Supports PDF, Markdown, text files.

---

## M

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
Standard protocol for connecting LLMs to external tools. MUXI uses MCP to integrate any compatible tool server (file systems, databases, APIs).

### Multi-Identity
Linking multiple identifiers (email, Slack ID, GitHub username) to a single user. Enables unified memory and context across platforms.

### Multi-Tenancy
User isolation in shared deployments. Each user has separate memory, credentials, and data. Requires PostgreSQL for production use.

---

## O

### Overlord
The central orchestrator and "brain" of a formation. Routes requests to agents, manages workflows, handles clarifications, synthesizes responses. Users talk to MUXI through the Overlord - never directly to agents.

---

## P

### Persistent Memory
Long-term storage that survives across sessions. Stores facts, preferences, and context. Backed by vector database (FAISSx or PostgreSQL).

### Persona
The Overlord's personality and communication style. Only the Overlord has a persona - agents have system prompts instead.

---

## R

### Registry
Central hub for discovering and sharing formations. Like npm/Docker Hub for MUXI formations. Supports semantic versioning.

### Runtime
Python execution environment for formations. Can run standalone or embedded in applications.

---

## S

### Scheduled Task
Recurring or one-time tasks created via natural language. Executes as the user who created it (using their credentials and memory context).

### Secret
Formation-level configuration values (API keys, connection strings). Stored encrypted, referenced as `${{ secrets.NAME }}` in AFS files.

### Session
One conversation thread with a user. Has its own working memory. Multiple sessions can exist per user.

### SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)
Predefined workflow template in Markdown. Triggered by specific phrases or conditions. Different from dynamic workflows which Overlord creates per-request.

### Structured Output
JSON or typed responses from agents. Enables programmatic processing of agent outputs. Supports JSON, HTML, Markdown, plain text formats.

---

## T

### Trigger
Webhook endpoint that activates formation behavior from external events. Uses Markdown templates with `${{ data.* }}` placeholders. Always executes asynchronously.

---

## U

### User Synopsis
LLM-generated summary of a user's identity, preferences, and context. Cached and refreshed periodically. Reduces token usage by ~85% compared to raw history.

---

## W

### Working Memory
Active context during a request. Includes retrieved memories, current conversation, and task state. Scoped to the current session.

### Workflow
Dynamic task decomposition created by the Overlord for complex requests. Breaks work into steps, assigns to agents, tracks progress. Created per-request (not predefined like SOPs).
