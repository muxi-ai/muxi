# Get Help & Support

Whether you're stuck on a configuration, found a bug, or just want to share what you've built - we're here to help.

MUXI is open source and community-driven. Most questions get answered in GitHub Discussions by maintainers and other users. For teams that need faster support, we offer priority options too.
