# MUXI Contributors Code of Conduct

Be kind and play nice with others.

Hopefully, we’re all grown-ups and don’t need the help of a long list of rules to know how to behave. If someone consistently acts in a way that disrupts or disrespects others, they’ll be asked to tone it down. If they don’t, they'll be banned from the community.

If you have concerns, reach out to [admin@muxi.org](mailto:admin@muxi.org).
